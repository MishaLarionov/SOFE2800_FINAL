# SOFE 2800 Final Project

## Database Config

Create a file called `php.ini` with the following:

```ini
[db_config]
ip = "server ip"
user = "username"
password = "password"

```

Inside php.ini is where a connection is made, 
when configuring to work on your local machine please alter this file to match your own database.
